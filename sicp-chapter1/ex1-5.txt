in applicative-order evaluation:
it gets in an infinite loop because it's always trying to expand (p), but (p) is recursively and infinitely expanding to itself

(test 0 (p))

(test 0 (p))

(test 0 (p))


in normal-order evaluation:

(test 0 (p))
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
(if TRUE 0 (p))
0



it never expands (p) because it didn't even need, since the if statemente didn't return (p)
