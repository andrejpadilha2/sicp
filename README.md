### Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

A repository with solutions to SICP exercises, including chapter 4 and 5 (usually missing on other repositories). The final exercises on Compilers I skipped and will try to go back after I study the topic with rigor.

Why bother reading SICP? https://medium.com/@andrejpadilha/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-db1e5cb56f0f

Hope it's useful to you!
