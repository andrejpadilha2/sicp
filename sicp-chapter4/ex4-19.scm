;; as the book points out
;; "26 The MIT implementors of Scheme support Alyssa on the following grounds: Eva is
;; in principle correct-the definitions should be regarded as simultaneous. But it seems
;; difficult to implement a general, efficient mechanism that does what Eva requires. In the
;; absence of such a mechanism, it is better to generate an error in the difficult cases of
;; simultaneous definitions (Alyssa's notion) than to produce an incorrect answer (as Ben
;; would have it)."
